Example: Creating a Custom Tool with Universal MCP

This example demonstrates how to create a custom tool using the Universal MCP framework.
The calculator application shows the basic structure needed to create your own tools.

Key Concepts:
1. Inheriting from BaseApplication
2. Implementing required methods
3. Registering tools
4. Setting up the MCP server
